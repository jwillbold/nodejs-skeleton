## NodeJS Skeleton Project

This is my basic project for all NodeJS apps. It provides an overall file
structure to build on and includes libraries, miscellaneous files and a self
signed certificate for the localhost. This is as an early integration of HTTPS
prevents problems that occur when developing and testing with HTTP and then
hosting it on HTTPS.

### Included Libs
  - Bootstrap 4.1
  - JQuery 3.3.1

### Predefined NodeJS packages
  - mocha
  - chai
  - jquery
  - pug
